# The OpenHMIS Commons Module
The commons module is an OpenMRS module that assists in the creation of other modules. It provides functional programming primitives and an entity data service framework which greatly simplifies getting data into and out of the OpenMRS database.

## Project Details
The project has no visibility by users from within OpenMRS, rather it is utilized by other modules. See the [Cashier Module][0]for an example of a module that is built on top of this module. We welcome any feedback and/or bug reports on our [bug tracking system][2].  

Our [demo site][1] is always running the currently released version of this module. 

## Repository Information
This repository follows the [git flow][3] branching model.  The current released build is always at the HEAD of the master branch while our current development version is at the HEAD of the develop branch.  A tag is created for each released version using the version number as the name; for example v1.5.0.
